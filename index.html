                <h3>Activity Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Reckoning Latitude</strong> engages students in building and using astrolabes to determine their latitude through Polaris measurements, connecting ancient navigation techniques to modern understanding of Earth's geometry. Teams experience the same systematic celestial measurement methods that guided explorers for millennia while learning why longitude determination remained unsolved until the chronometer revolution. Students analyze measurement accuracy and connect historical navigation challenges to modern GPS technology.</p>
